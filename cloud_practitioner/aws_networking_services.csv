"What is an Elastic Network Interface (ENI)?","A logical networking component that represents a NIC. ENIs can be attached and detached from EC2 instances, and the configuration of the ENI will be maintained."
"What are Flow Logs in AWS?","Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in a VPC. Flow log data is stored using Amazon CloudWatch Logs."
"At what levels can flow logs be created?","VPC, Subnet, Network interface."
"Can peering connections be created with VPCs in different regions?","Yes, peering connections can be created with VPCs in different regions."
"How do you specify the CIDR block for a subnet?","When you create a subnet, you specify the CIDR block for the subnet, which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block."
"Where must each subnet reside?","Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones."
"How is a subnet known as a public subnet?","If a subnet’s traffic is routed to an internet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet."
"How is a subnet known as a private subnet?","If a subnet doesn’t have a route to the internet gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet."
"How is a subnet known as a VPN-only subnet?","If a subnet doesn’t have a route to the internet gateway, but has its traffic routed to a virtual private gateway for a VPN connection, the subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet."
"What is an Internet Gateway in AWS?","An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet."
"Where do Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide a firewall/security layer?","At the subnet level."
"Where do Security Groups provide a firewall/security layer?","At the instance level."
"What are the differences between Security Groups and Network ACLs in terms of where they operate?","Security Group operates at the instance (interface) level, Network ACL operates at the subnet level."
"What are NAT instances?","NAT instances are managed by you, used to enable private subnet instances to access the Internet."
"How are NAT gateways different from NAT instances?","NAT gateways are managed for you by AWS, are highly available in each AZ, can scale automatically up to 45Gbps, have no need to patch, and are not associated with any security groups."
