"Question","Answer"
"What is the primary function of a Security Group in AWS?","A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic."
"True or False: Security Groups are stateful.","True. This means if you allow an incoming request from an IP, the response is automatically allowed, regardless of outbound rules."
"Can you specify allow rules for a security group based on domain names?","No. Security Groups operate at the instance level and only evaluate the IP protocol, port, and source/destination IP."
"How many security groups can you assign to an EC2 instance?","You can assign up to 5 security groups to an EC2 instance."
"What is the primary function of a Network ACL in AWS?","Network ACLs act as a firewall for associated subnets, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level."
"True or False: Network ACLs are stateful.","False. Network ACLs are stateless, which means return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules."
"How are rules evaluated in Network ACLs?","Rules are evaluated in number order, starting from the lowest number. The first rule that matches the traffic is applied, regardless of any higher-numbered rule that might contradict it."
"What happens if no rule matches the traffic in Network ACLs?","If no rule matches, the traffic is denied (default deny)."
"Can you block IP addresses using Security Groups?","No, Security Groups only allow allow rules. If you need to deny traffic, you'd use a Network ACL."
"What are the default rules for a new security group in AWS?","All outbound traffic is allowed, while all inbound traffic is denied."
"Can you associate a security group with multiple EC2 instances?","Yes, you can associate a security group with multiple EC2 instances."
"True or False: You can associate a Network ACL to multiple subnets in the same VPC.","False. Although you can associate multiple subnets with a single Network ACL, you cannot associate a subnet with more than one Network ACL at a time."
