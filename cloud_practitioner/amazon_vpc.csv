 "Question","Answer"
"What is Amazon VPC?","Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a service offered by AWS that allows users to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where they can launch AWS resources in a virtual network."
"How does Amazon VPC provide isolation and security?","With VPC, users can define a private IP address space and then segment it into multiple isolated subnets. This allows for separation of resources and environments."
"What are public and private subnets in VPC?","A public subnet is a subnet that has direct access to the internet via an internet gateway. A private subnet doesn't have direct access to the internet."
"What is an Internet Gateway in VPC?","An Internet Gateway is a VPC component that allows communication between instances in the VPC and the internet."
"How do Route Tables work in VPC?","Route Tables in VPC define rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet must be associated with a route table."
"What are Network ACLs in Amazon VPC?","Network ACLs (Access Control Lists) are stateless traffic filters that can be applied to a subnet. They can allow or deny traffic based on IP protocol, service port, and source/destination IP or CIDR block."
"How are Security Groups different from Network ACLs in VPC?","Security Groups are stateful traffic filters that operate at the instance level, while Network ACLs are stateless and work at the subnet level."
"What are Virtual Private Gateway & Direct Connect in VPC?","Virtual Private Gateway is for VPN connections between AWS and on-premises data centers. Direct Connect is a dedicated line connection between AWS and on-premises data centers."
"How do NAT Instances and NAT Gateways assist private subnets in a VPC?","NAT Instances and NAT Gateways allow instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the internet while preventing unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet."
"What is VPC Peering?","VPC Peering allows one VPC to connect to another in a peer-to-peer relationship, enabling traffic between VPCs using private IP addresses."
"What is the purpose of VPC EndPoints?","VPC EndPoints allow traffic between your VPC and other AWS services to be routed within the AWS network, avoiding the public internet."
"What is an Elastic IP Address in VPC?","An Elastic IP Address is a static IPv4 address associated with the AWS account, useful for hosting services like websites with a consistent IP."
"What are VPC Flow Logs?","Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in a VPC, aiding in monitoring and security."
